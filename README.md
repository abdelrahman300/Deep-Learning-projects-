## Installation

To set up the environment for running the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/Deep-Learning-projects.git
   cd Deep-Learning-projects
   pip install -r requirements.txt
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.animation as animation

# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Set up the data
x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 100)
y = np.sin(x)

# Create a line object
line, = ax.plot(x, y)

# Animation function
def update(frame):
    line.set_ydata(np.sin(x + frame / 10.0))
    return line,

# Create an animation
ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=100, blit=True)

# Show the animation
plt.show()
